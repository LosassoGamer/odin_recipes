# odin_recipes
My first Odin Project! This is where it **all** started.

So *basically*, this is the first project we make in **Odin Project**. Will update this file as it goes on.

# PROGRESS TRACKING:
## Day One:
Started with developing the structure of the main file, thus creating the first recipe **branch**. This would come to be the lasagna recipe which was completed. Plus, added some *CSS* nuances to the index file to make it look better, even thoguh it has a lot of room for improvement.

## Day Two:
Various updates on README.md and planning the other recipes for the project, while also researching a bit about *CSS* to improve the overall appearance of my project.
